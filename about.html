    <p class="about-text">
        The Saturn Movement is an underground electronic collective that embraces the raw pulse of club culture.
        Emerging from smoke, light, and resonance, our identity lives between the physical and the ethereal —
        where frequencies shape space, and dance becomes a shared language.
        <br><br>
        Rooted in the nightlife fabric of Milan, Berlin, Naples, Paris, and Barcelona,
        the collective unites dancers, artists, producers, designers, and explorers of the night.
        Each gathering is a moment suspended in time: a merger of architecture, sound design,
        and emotional energy. 
        <br><br>
        The Saturn Movement is not simply an event.  
        It is a living organism.  
        A constellation of minds aligned toward experimentation, aesthetics, and sonic identity.
        <br><br>
        This website translates that philosophy into a digital environment built on minimalist,
        brutalist, and industrial cues — a structure where typography becomes architecture
        and rhythm becomes navigation.
